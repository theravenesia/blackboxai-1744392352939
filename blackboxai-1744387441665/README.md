# User Workspace

User Workspace is a web application that utilizes Express.js to create a simple flight information display system. It retrieves flight data from a SQLite database and presents it in a user-friendly format using EJS templates.

## Project Overview

This project provides a foundational setup for creating a web application that displays flight information. It involves a basic backend using Express and a SQLite database for data storage. The application is structured to allow easy expansion and customization.

## Installation

To get started with User Workspace, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-workspace.git
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create and populate the database:**
   The database is automatically created and populated with sample data when you run the server. Ensure you have SQLite installed and accessible.

4. **Start the application:**
   You can start the server with the following command:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The application will be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage

After starting the server, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. You should see the flight schedule displayed in a tabular format.

## Features

- Display flight information including flight number, airline, direction, airport, scheduled and estimated times, status, and remarks.
- Dynamic data retrieval from a SQLite database.
- EJS templating for rendering views.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies which are specified in the `package.json`:

- **Express:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **EJS:** A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **SQLite3:** A lightweight database that is easy to set up and integrate with Node.js applications.

Here are the dependencies listed in the `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "ejs": "^3.1.10",
    "express": "^5.1.0",
    "sqlite3": "^5.1.7"
}
```

## Project Structure

Here’s a brief overview of the project structure:

```
user-workspace/
├── database.js     # Database setup and schema definition
├── package.json    # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json  # Dependency lock file
├── server.js       # Main application server file
└── views/          # Directory for EJS views (not listed)
    └── index.ejs   # EJS template for rendering flight information
```

### Important Files

- **database.js:** Contains the SQLite database connection and initializes the `flights` table with sample data.
- **server.js:** The main entry point of the application that sets up the Express server and handles routing.
- **views/index.ejs:** The EJS template that formats and displays the flight data.
